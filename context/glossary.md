## Technical Terms

### Token Budget

### Prompt
A carefully crafted instruction given to an LLM to guide its output for specific tasks like entity extraction.

### LLM (Large Language Model)
A machine learning model trained on vast amounts of text data, capable of understanding and generating human-like text.

### MCP (Model Control Protocol)
A protocol for interacting with external tools and services, including knowledge graph management.

## Project-Specific Terms

### Heinz Doofenshmirtz
An AI agent with a distinct personality, assigned to develop knowledge graph prompts as a perpetual intern.

### Workflow Snapshot

### Candidate Promotion
